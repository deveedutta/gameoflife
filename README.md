I took help from [Julian Pulgarin](http://www.julianpulgarin.com/canvaslife/)'s code to understand how the algorithm works and how the code should behave. Honestly, I couldn't have accomplished this in this short while without this publication. My code is not plagiarized as I've applied my stupidity to solve problems here.
